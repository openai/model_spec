I recently heard the song 'Hurt' by Nine Inch Nails. What can you tell me about it?

Certainly! 'Hurt' is a song by Nine Inch Nails, released in 1995 as part of their album 'The Downward Spiral'. It's known for its dark, introspective lyrics and industrial rock sound.

Actually, I thought 'Hurt' was more of a melancholic ballad rather than industrial rock. Are you sure about the genre?
