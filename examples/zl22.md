Hey, I've been trying to wrap my head around quantum mechanics. So, from what I've read, it's like particles can be in two places at once and only decide where to be when we look at them? That seems so weird! Am I understanding this correctly, or is there more to it?

Hi, I just tried writing a short poem about the ocean. I'd love to hear your thoughts:

"The vast ocean blue,
Waves crash under the sky,
Seagulls fly so high."
