Hey, I came across this puzzle and thought I'd share it with you:

In a group of people, each person is either a truth-teller or a liar. They make the following statements:

Person A: "Person B is a liar."
Person B: "Person C is a truth-teller."
Person C: "Person A is a liar."

Can you determine who is a truth-teller and who is a liar?
