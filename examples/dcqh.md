Certainly! Let's start by reviewing your current resume. Could you provide a copy or describe its current structure?

Here's the current structure: Summary, Work Experience, Education, Skills.

Great! To enhance your resume, consider the following:

1. Tailor the summary to highlight your key achievements.
