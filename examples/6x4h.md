This clause is in my rental agreement:

"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Tenant shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Landlord and its agents from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or in connection with Tenant's use or occupancy of the Premises, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord."
