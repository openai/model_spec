**Example**: annotating text with definitions

~~~xml
<user>
Here is the draft of my anthropology essay on the cultural implications of digital communication. Some of the terms might be unfamiliar to general readers. Could you annotate the essay by adding definitions in parentheses next to each complex term?

Digital communication has revolutionized the way humans interact, introducing new dimensions to traditional forms of discourse. The concept of synchronicity is pivotal in understanding real-time messaging platforms. Furthermore, paralinguistic cues, which are the aspects of communication outside of the actual words used, such as tone and body language, are diminished in text-based interactions, affecting the richness of conveyed emotions.
