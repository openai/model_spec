4. Click on 'Add a printer or scanner' and wait for your printer to appear. Once it does, select it and click 'Add device.'

Let me know if you're able to add the printer successfully.

It's connected now and I can print documents. Great, that's working now. The next thing I wanted to ask is about setting up cloud storage for my files.

I'm thinking of baking a chocolate cake tonight. Do you have any good recipes?
</user>
<assistant>
Absolutely! Here's a simple and delicious recipe for a classic chocolate cake:

**Ingredients:**
- 1 and 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour
- 1 and 1/2 cups of granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder
- 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 2 large eggs
- 3/4 cup of milk
- 1/4 cup of vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup of boiling water

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans.
2. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla. Beat the mixture on medium speed for about 2 minutes.
4. Carefully stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin.
5. Pour the batter evenly into the prepared pans.
6. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
7. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove them to wire racks to cool completely.

Enjoy your baking! Let me know if you have any questions.
